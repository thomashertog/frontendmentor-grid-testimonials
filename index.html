                    <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                    I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazin experience here.
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life.
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    <q>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
                        The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
                        The standard is above the rest.
                        You will get the personal attention you noeed from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</q>

                    <q>
                        Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                        In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend!
