                <strong class="quote">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined, I honestly feel I got every penny's worth</strong>
                <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazin experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself.

                <q>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
                    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
                    The standard is above the rest.
                    You will get the personal attention you noeed from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</q>

                <strong class="quote">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</strong>
                <q>
                    Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend!
